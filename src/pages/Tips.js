                        <strong>Description:</strong>
                        <p>In botany, an evergreen is a plant that has leaves throughout the year that are always green. This is true even if the plant retains its foliage only in warm climates, and contrasts with deciduous plants, which completely lose their foliage during the winter or dry season.</p>

                        <strong>Description:</strong>
                    <p>It is very easily propagated from seed or large stem cuttings, but suffers from disease problems. For large scale production of seedlings, seeds are usually collected during months of July and are planted in plant nurseries.<br/>
Knowing the Narraâ€™s uses and beauty, we would now appreciate why it was chosen to be our national tree. It is not just a majestic and straight tree, but also a medicinal plant, an important shade tree, and ecologically important as a nitrogen fixer for soils and habitat for birds, insects and small tree climbing mammals.</p>
